# Projects

* Contains projects that I want to work on.
* I would not be surprised if this repo stays virtually empty for a while.

## Things I want to put in here

* A new (basic) (very basic) programming language JARCL (Just Another Rust Compiled Language)
* A brainfuck compiler.
* Projects from `Rust in Action`.
* Mostly stuff written in Rust. Possibly a small amount of C++. Possibly some Python.

## Hopes and Dreams

One day my friend told me to create something and then I watched a video and was inspired to create the exact same thing that this guy had already created but with a small difference so it COUNTS ok.
