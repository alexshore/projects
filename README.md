# Projects

* Contains projects (as submodules) that I want to work on.
* I would not be surprised if this repo stays virtually completely empty for a little while.

## Things I want to put in here

* A new (basic) (very basic) programming language.
* A brainfuck *trans*piler (probably to a couple of different languages).
* A brainfuck *com*piler.
* Projects from `Rust in Action` and maybe some other books.
* Advent of Code 2023 (and possibly previous years also).
* Mostly stuff written in Rust. Possibly a small amount of C++. Possibly some Python.
