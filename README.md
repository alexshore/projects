# Projects

Random projects linked as submodules.

## Things I want to put in here

* A new (basic) (very basic) programming language.
* A brainfuck *trans*piler (probably to a couple of different languages).
* A brainfuck *com*piler.
* Games. Starting with Tic-Tac-Toe and progressing to Othello and hopefully Chess.
* Given projects from books.
* Advent of Code 2023 (and possibly previous years also).
* Mostly stuff written in Rust. Possibly a small amount of C++. Possibly some Python.
